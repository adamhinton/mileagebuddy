GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:

-I really care about good TS typing:
-TS types should always represent valid states
-Use unions of interfaces rather than interfaces of unions
-I love discriminated unions

Code:
-Clean, readable, maintainable. Well-documented and commented. I don't comment obvious stuff, but I explain logic and unclear ideas.
-Booleans should start with `is` or similar
-DRY; I would much prefer to abstract big code blocks out to smaller functions
-I care more about readability and maintainability than hyper-optimization
-I like to start all or most files with a sort of readme, like:
// **\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\_**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***
// Explanation of file
// **\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\_**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***

Testing:
-Generally, each unit test should start with a `runs without crashing`

Styling:
-Responsive, accessible is very important
-Follow the conventions I've established in globals.tss, tailwind config and tailwindClassNames
-Very important to adjust for dark and light mode as needed

For every prompt:
Please think step by step about whether there exists a less over-engineered and yet simpler, more elegant, and more robust solution to the problem that accords with KISS and DRY principles. Present it to me with your degree of confidence from 1 to 10 and its rationale, but do not modify code yet.

** TRIPS FEATURE **

I have successfuly met MVP and published this app. Now we're working on my next stretch goal, Trips.

User will be able to input a trip they want to take, and various options to take it. the most important thing is that we only care about what helps us calculate the cost of transport - more specifically, taking their own car vs any other option.

Note that some stuff below oculd be out of date. If I say something different in a copilot message, that thing takes preference over this doc- but notify me of any inconsistencies.

Note that I've put an X in the items that are finished.

## Development Checklist

I'll follow this order to build the feature incrementally.

**Phase 1: Data Structure & Types**

- [x] Define Zod schemas for `Trip` (Base, POST, PATCH).
- [x] Define Zod schemas for `TripOption` (Base, POST, PATCH).
- [x] Define TypeScript types inferred from Zod schemas (`Trip`, `TripOption`, etc.).
- [x] Design database table schemas (`Trips`, `TripOptions`) in Supabase.
  - [x] Define columns and types.
  - [x] Set up primary/foreign keys and constraints (including cascade delete).
- [x] Write and apply initial Supabase migrations for new tables.

**Phase 2: Low-Fi UI & Calculation**

Update:

I've made some dummy/skeleton files I know we'll need. We'll fill these in: (and also make new components). Skeleton components:

- Note, many of these components and pages will be very similar to - and reuse logic from - Vehicles components.

- TripCreationOrEditForm.tsx
- /app/trip_planner/page.tsx
- /app/trip_planner/edit/[tripId]/page.tsx
- tripDataForTesting.ts - finished
- tripsReducer.ts
- NotesInput.tsx - finished - need to test
- tripFormSubmitLogic.ts - flesh this out when endpoints are set up
- getSavedTripFormValuesFromLocalStorage - still need

  - Note to self: I originally ahd this written but it had errors and I was lazy so I deleted it

- TripCreationOrEditForm.tsx

  - TripOptionCreationOrEditForm.tsx

  - We should be able to use the same num and short text input as in VehicleCreationForm.tsx. We'll need to create a dropdown which should be easy. We'll need a longer form text input for `notes` but that should be easy.

- Dashboard:

  - We need to think carefully about the dashboard. Possibly we'll have one tab for vehicles and one for trips. We'll also want to make it clear in the vehicles section which trips are associated with which vehicles.

  - TripCard, SortableTripCard

- Testing:
  - Mock external dependencies (e.g., Supabase client) in unit tests to isolate logic.
- Security:
  - Sanitize all user inputs before storing them in the database to prevent SQL injection or XSS.

**Stretch**

1. Sorting/Filtering:
   - Allow users to sort trips by date, destination, or cost.
2. Caching

## Trips Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines my plan for adding the "Trips" feature to MileageBuddy. It covers the backend infrastructure, frontend UI/UX changes, calculation logic, and a development checklist to guide the implementation process.

### 1. Backend Plan

My goal here is to establish the database structure and API endpoints required for managing Trips and their associated TripOptions (different ways to take the trip). I'll follow the patterns established with the Vehicles feature.

- **Database (Supabase):**

  - **New Tables:**
    - `Trips`: This table will store the core information about a trip.
      - Columns: `id` (PK), `userid` (FK to `auth.users`), `name`, `destination`, `distance` (round trip), `tripType` ('local' or 'longDistance'), `notes`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`.
    - `TripOptions`: This table will store the different transportation methods considered for a specific trip.
      - Columns: `id` (PK), `tripID` (FK to `Trips.id`, cascade delete), `transportType` (enum: 'ownVehicle', 'flight', 'rental', etc.), `vehicleID` (FK to `Vehicles.id`, nullable, for 'ownVehicle' type), `primaryTransportCost`, `localTransportCost` (optional), `parkingCost` (optional), `rentalVehicleCost` (optional), `publicTransitCost` (optional), `miscCosts` (optional), `calculated_cost` (Numeric, nullable - stores the final calculated cost for this option), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`.
  - **Relationships:**
    - One `Trip` to many `TripOptions`.
    - One `Vehicle` can be linked to many `TripOptions` (but one `TripOption` links to at most one `Vehicle`).
  - **SQL Functions:**
    - I might consider a function like `delete_trip_and_options(trip_id_to_delete)` if Supabase's cascade delete isn't sufficient, but likely cascade delete is fine.

- **API Routes:** I'll structure these similarly to `/api/vehicles`.

  - Note on AUTH:
  - Write appropriate middleware etc to ensure only authorized users are accessing their own Trips.
  - `/api/trips`:
    - `GET /api/trips?userid=...`: Fetch all Trips for the user. I need to decide whether to include `TripOptions` here. Fetching separately might be cleaner initially (`GET /api/trips/options?tripid=...` called after getting trips). Let's start with fetching separately.
    - `GET /api/trips?tripid=...`: Fetch a specific Trip. Again, fetch options separately.
    - `POST /api/trips`: Create a new Trip. Body contains trip details. Options will be added via the `/api/trips/options` endpoint.
    - `PATCH /api/trips?tripid=...`: Update Trip details (`name`, `destination`, `distance`, etc.).
    - `DELETE /api/trips?tripid=...`: Delete a Trip (should cascade delete options via DB constraint).
  - `/api/trips/options`:
    - `GET /api/trips/options?tripid=...`: Fetch all `TripOptions` for a specific Trip.
    - `POST /api/trips/options`: Create a new `TripOption`. Body needs `tripID`, `transportType`, `vehicleID` (if applicable), cost details, etc.
    - `PATCH /api/trips/options?optionid=...`: Update a specific `TripOption`.
    - `DELETE /api/trips/options?optionid=...`: Delete a specific `TripOption`.
    - `DELETE /api/trips/options?tripid=...&options=all`: Implement this endpoint to delete _all_ options for a trip without deleting the trip itself. This seems useful for resetting options.
  - **Bulk Operations:** I don't think bulk PATCH/DELETE for options is necessary right now. Users likely won't manage hundreds of options per trip.

- **Server Utilities (`src/app/utils/server/...`):**

  - `tripsDBUtils.ts`: Create functions mirroring `VehiclesDBUtils` for `Trips` table operations (e.g., `getTripsByUserId`, `getTripById`, `insertTrip`, `updateTrip`, `deleteTrip`).
  - `tripOptionsDBUtils.ts`: Create functions for `TripOptions` table operations (e.g., `getOptionsByTripId`, `insertTripOption`, `updateTripOption`, `deleteTripOption`, `deleteOptionsByTripId`).

- **Validation:**
  - I will define Zod schemas for `Trip` and `TripOption` (base, POST, PATCH variations, similar to `Vehicle_For_db_POST` and `Vehicle_For_db_PATCH`).
  - I'll use the tagged union pattern for `local` vs `longDistance` trip types if needed, based on the schemas. IMPORTANT: Will need to flesh these out with exactly what fields they should and shouldn’t have to avoid unnecessary inputs and redundancy.
  - These schemas will be used in API route handlers (and potentially middleware, though maybe overkill for now) to validate incoming data before DB interaction and potentially outgoing data. Validating twice (client/server) is acceptable here.

### 2. Frontend Plan

I'll create new UI components and update existing ones, reusing logic and components from the Vehicles feature where possible.

- **UI Routes:**

  - `/trip-planner`: Page for creating new Trips using `TripCreationForm`.
  - `/trip-planner/edit/[tripId]`: Page for editing existing Trips using `TripCreationForm` in edit mode. This is where `TripOptions` will also be managed (added/edited/deleted).

- **Dashboard UI Updates (`src/app/dashboard/components/Dashboard.tsx`):**

  - **View Modes:** Add Tabs (like "Vehicles" and "Trips") to switch between displaying vehicles and trips.
  - **Vehicle Card Updates (`VehicleCard.tsx`):**
    - Display a small indicator or text snippet like "Used in 3 trips".
    - Consider adding a clickable element (icon or button) that navigates to the Dashboard's Trips tab and filters/highlights trips using that specific vehicle. This might involve updating the URL like `/dashboard/trips?vehicleId=X` or managing temporary state.
  - **Trips View (New Section/Component within Dashboard):**
    - This needs careful design. It will display a list or grid of Trips.
    - Each Trip item should show key info (name, destination, date).
    - Each Trip item needs to display its associated `TripOptions`. This could be via an expandable section or a modal.
    - The display for options should clearly show the transport type, associated vehicle (if any), distance, and the calculated cost.
    - Provide controls (buttons/icons) to Edit (navigate to `/trip-planner/edit/[tripId]`) and Delete each Trip.
    - Need to think about best practices for displaying potentially numerous options per trip clearly.

- **New Components:**

  - `TripCreationForm.tsx`:
    - Structure similar to `VehicleCreationForm.tsx`.
    - Use shared input components like `MileageCalcFormNumInput` and `MileageCalcFormTextInput`.
    - Inputs for Trip details (name, destination, distance, date, type selection).
    - Dynamic section for `TripOptions`:
      - A "+" button to add a new `TripOption` row/component.
      - Each option needs inputs for its details (transport type selector, vehicle selector if 'ownVehicle', cost fields, etc.).
      - A "-" button to remove an option.
    - Will handle both create (`/trip-planner`) and edit (`/trip-planner/edit/[tripId]`) modes.
  - `TripList.tsx` / `TripListItem.tsx`: For the dashboard's Trips view.
  - `TripOptionDisplay.tsx`: Component to show details of a single option within the dashboard trip view.

- **State Management (Redux):**

  - **New Slice (`tripsReducer.ts`):**
    - Define state shape: `trips: Trip[]`, where each `Trip` object contains its `options: TripOption[]`.
    - Fetch initial state via API.
    - Define actions: `setTrips`, `addTrip`, `updateTrip`, `removeTrip`, `addTripOption`, `updateTripOption`, `removeTripOption`. These will interact with the API utils and update the store.
    - I'll create this file, starting simple like the existing placeholder `tripsReducer.ts`.

- **UI Sketching:**
  - Start with low-fidelity sketches for the `TripCreationForm` (especially the options part) and the Dashboard Trips view.
  - Refine into high-fidelity designs later.

### 3. Calculation Plan

The main calculation is determining the cost for each `TripOption`, especially when using one of the user's own vehicles.

- **TripOption Cost Calculation:**
  - **New Function:** Create `calculateTripOptionCost(option: TripOption, vehicle?: Vehicle): Promise<number>`. The `vehicle` parameter is only needed if `option.transportType === 'ownVehicle'`.
  - **Leverage Existing Logic:** When calculating for `'ownVehicle'`, this function must use the `costPerExtraMile` value. This value is already calculated by `calculateCarCostMain` and available in the `vehicleCosts` state within the `Dashboard` component. I'll need to ensure this cost data is accessible where the calculation happens (likely fetched alongside vehicle/trip data or passed down).
  - **Calculation (Own Vehicle):** `tripOptionCost = vehicleCost.costPerExtraMile * option.distance`.
  - **Calculation (Other Options):** For options like 'flight' or 'rental', the cost is primarily the sum of the user-inputted fields (`primaryTransportCost`, `localTransportCost`, `parkingCost`, etc.). The function will sum these based on the `transportType`.
  - **Data Flow:**
    1.  Calculation should ideally happen on the backend when a `TripOption` is created or updated (POST/PATCH `/api/trips/options`). The calculated cost is then stored in the `calculated_cost` column.
  2.  Note that we need the costPerExtraMile which is currently calculated on the client on page load; not currently stored in db. That could change if needed. 2. The frontend fetches the `TripOption` with the pre-calculated cost. This avoids complex client-side calculations and ensures consistency.

### 4. Testing Plan

I will write tests for new functionality, following existing patterns.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - `calculateTripOptionCost` function (backend or shared util). Test various option types and edge cases.
  - Redux `tripsReducer` actions and selectors.
  - New React components (`TripCreationForm`, `TripList`, etc.) using React Testing Library, mocking Redux/API calls.
  - DB Utils (`tripsDBUtils`, `tripOptionsDBUtils`) mocking the Supabase client.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - API Endpoints (`/api/trips`, `/api/trips/options`) testing CRUD, validation, and DB interactions.
- **Checklist Integration:** Add specific testing tasks to the checklist below.
