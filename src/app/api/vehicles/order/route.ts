// ____________________________________________
// This API route has just one endpoint and one simple purpose.
// It deals with vehiclesOrder, which is a property on each Vehicle
// This determines the order they should display in the UI. It's (theoretically) incremented.
// So when a vehicle is added/deleted/edited, other orders may have to be updated.
// This can be done through DnD in the dashboard, or adding/editing/deleting a vehicle.
