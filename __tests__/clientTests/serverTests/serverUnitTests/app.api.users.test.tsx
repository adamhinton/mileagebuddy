// README
// This file is for UNIT tests. It tests API endpoint logic with dummy data, doesn't interact with an actual DB.
//  See README in servertests/serverunit tests for more info.

// IMPORTANT: All backend tests must have this at the top of the file, because their jest-environment is different from the one specified in our jest config (since it's different for client vs server tests)
