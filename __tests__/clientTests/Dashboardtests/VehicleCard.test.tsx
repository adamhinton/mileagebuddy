// This is (obviously) tests for VehicleCard.tsx
// This is a component that displays a vehicle card with its calculated costs
// Also contains edit and delete buttons
// It has drag and drop functionality, but that's handled by its parent component SortableVehicleCard.tsx, so that isn't tested here
