## React

- Use functional components
- Use hooks for state management
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## TypeScript

- Use consistent object property shorthand: const obj = { name, age }
- Avoid implicit any
- Clean, DRY, efficient TS code.
- NO anys

## Project

- This is MileageBuddy, a project to help users calculate costs of car ownership
- With user input it'll calculate the cost of their car per year, per mile, and they can also calculate costs of individual trips and extra miles
- Plan to make user accounts and store data about trips and vehicles etc.
- Will have dark mode
- When giving me code to copy, ALWAYS include my original comments and other things. This is so I can paste it right in to the file.

## Styling

- using TailwindCSS
- String template literal Tailwind class names for dynamic styling

## Validation

- Will use Zod
